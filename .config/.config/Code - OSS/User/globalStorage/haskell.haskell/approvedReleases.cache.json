1.5.0\r\n\r\nTime for another hls release:\r\n\r\n- @pepeiborra has done an epic work to improve performance, redefining some of the core pieces of HLS\r\n  - You can take an overall look to improvements in [these slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16FpmiHXX_rd2gAf5XVgWAIr4kg-AkUqX/view)\r\n  - Performance would be noticeable in large projects without too much template haskell usage\r\n- We have fourmolu support for ghc-9.0.1 thanks to @georgefst\r\n- We have got improvements over import suggestions thanks to @yoshitsugu and @alexnaspo\r\n- Completions also has been

1.5.0\r\n\r\n- As we noted in the previous release we have dropped support for ghc versions 8.6.4, 8.10.2, 8.10.3, 8.10.4 in *this release*\r\n- We will drop support for ghc versions 8.10.5 and 8.8.3

July release of HLS arrives! This release includes binaries for GHC 9.0.1\r\nand some new interesting features. Here is the brief summary of changes:\r\n\r\n- Binaries for GHC 9.0.1 are added by @anka-213.\r\n  - It does not support all plugins yet, but core GHCIDE features will work. For the detailed information that which plugins work, please refer [this list.](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/297#issue-675581824)\r\n- Call hierarchy plugin is added, contributed by @July541.\r\n  ![hierarchy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12473268/127550041-094151a6-be7b-484a-bb82-c61f326ca503.gif)\r\n- Now completions work with definitions from non-imported modules, thanks to @pepeiborra.\r\n  ![completion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12473268/127543694-718ae043-38f2-4fb0-be71-317f5f93b443.gif)\r\n- Eval plugin\r\n  - The plugin supports GHC 9.0.1, thanks to @berberman.\r\n  - `:info` command is added by @akrmn.\r\n  - The plugin uses the same default language as GHCi with @fmehta's patch.\r\n- Wingman, where most changes owing to @isovector\r\n  - Wingman no longer changes the fixity of function definitions.\r\n  - Wingman now gives unique names to the holes it generates.\r\n  - Wingman's ability to reason about polymorphic and GADT types is significantly improved.\r\n  - Wingman no longer suggests homomorphic destructs when the codomain is larger than the domain.\r\n  - \"Complete case constructors\" action supports empty lambda cases.\r\n  - Wingman now gives a warning if it ran out of gas during \"attempt to fill hole\".\r\n  - Metaprogramming for Wingman has been improved with symbolic-name support and the `pointwise` combinator.\r\n  - An option to enable/disable Wingman's proof state styling is added.\r\n  - Hole fit suggestions are now disabled for performance reasons when using

changes:\r\n\r\n- Basic support for GHC 9.0.1 is added.  \r\n  It does not support all plugins yet, but core GHCIDE features will work. For the detailed information that which plugins work, please refer [this list](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/297#issuecomment-855522891).\r\n- Support for GHC 8.10.5 is added.  \r\n  ~~Note that macOS version is unfortunately not included in this release because of [a GHC issue with `network` package](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/19968).~~\r\n  Finally, we can provide executable for GHC 8.10.5 on macOS as well. (Thanks @mouse07410 for finding workaround!)\r\n- HLS wrapper and GHCIDE session loader uses the same logic with implicit-hie.  \r\n  This fixes [a build issue](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/1782) of a stack project with implicit `hie.yaml` .\r\n- Wingman plugin has added numerous features and fixed many bugs:\r\n  - It now supports tactic metaprogramming!  \r\n    For list of commands, see [this document](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/blob/master/plugins/hls-tactics-plugin/COMMANDS.md#wingman-metaprogram-command-reference).  \r\n    ![https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/blob/master/plugins/hls-tactics-plugin/COMMANDS.md#wingman-metaprogram-command-reference](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/307223/118190278-bdf24f80-b3f7-11eb-8838-b08a2582d7f1.gif)\r\n  - \"Refine hole\" and \"Split all function arguments\" code actions are publicly opened.\r\n  - \"Empty case split\" code lens is added.\r\n  - The name generator is fixed [to avoid dangerous summon rituals](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/1760).\r\n  - Many bugs related to type families and GADTs are fixed.\r\n- We support [nix flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes), an upcoming way to manage dependencies in nix.\r\n- Every plugin (other than example plugins) now lives in its own package.\r\n\r\n### Pull requests merged for 1.2.0\r\n\r\n- Cleanup stack build output

Language Server 1.1.0 has finally come! Many thanks to all contributors -- since the last release, we have merged over 100 PRs!\r\nAs always, there are many internal bug fixes and performance improvements in ghcide. Apart from that,\r\n\r\n* Wingman gets many enhancements, thanks to @isovector for this epic work!\r\n  * Wingman actions can now be bound to editor hotkeys\r\n  * Experimental support for \"jump to next unsolved hole\"\r\n  * Improved layout algorithm --- don't reflow instances, or break do-blocks\r\n  * Wingman can now deal with GADTs, rank-n types and pattern synonyms\r\n  * Wingman now respects user-written bindings on the left side of the equals sign\r\n  * Significantly more-natural synthesized code when dealing with newtypes, infix operators, records and strings\r\n  * Improved user experience --- less waiting, and friendly errors for when things go wrong\r\n* hlint plugin not working in some cases gets fixed\r\n* annoying log message \"haskell-lsp:incoming message parse error\" gets fixed in `lsp-1.2`\r\n* eval plugin now supports `it` variable, like GHCi\r\n* verbose message \"No cradle found for ... Proceeding with implicit cradle\" is GONE\r\n* type lenses plugin now has its custom config `mode` (enum) [`always`] to control its working mode:\r\n  * `always`: always displays type signature lenses of global bindings\r\n  * `exported`: similar to `always`, but only displays for exported global bindings\r\n  * `diagnostics`: follows diagnostic messages produced by GHC\r\n* top-level LSP option `completionSnippetsOn` and `maxNumberOfProblems` are deprecated\r\n* completions plugin now has its custom config:\r\n  * `autoExtendOn` (boolean) [`true`]: whether to enable auto extending import lists\r\n  * `snippetsOn` (boolean) [`true`]: wheter to enable completion snippets, taking the place of `completionSnippetsOn`\r\n* Wingman has its custom config:\r\n  * `timeout_duration` (integer) [`2`]: the timeout for Wingman actions, in seconds\r\n  * `features` (string) [`\"\"`]: feature set used by Wingman (See [the README of Wingman](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/tree/master/plugins/hls-tactics-plugin#readme))\r\n  * `max_use_ctor_actions` (integer) [`5`]: maximum number of `Use constructor <x>` code actions that can appear\r\n  * `hole_severity` (enum) [`none`]: the severity to use when showing hole diagnostics\r\n* LSP symbols of typeclass and type families are more appropriate\r\n* test suite of plugins are reorganized, which no longer need to be run with `test-server` executable\r\n* two new packages `hls-test-utils` and `hls-stylish-haskell-plugin` are extracted\r\n\r\nThis version uses `lsp-1.2.0`, `hls-plugin-api-1.1.0`, and `ghcide-1.2.0.2`.\r\n\r\n### Pull requests merged for 1.1.0\r\n\r\n- Restore compat. with haddock-library

is the celebratory release of Haskell Language Server 1.0.0!\r\nThis release includes a lot of internal changes, bug fixes, leaks plugged, and performance improvements, thanks to all our contributors.\r\nAmong others,\r\n- We added the support for GHC 8.10.4, and removed the support for GHC 8.10.1\r\n    Afterward, we will support upmost 3 patch versions for each minor version of GHC, if no special situation happens.\r\n- As by hie-bios >= 0.7.3, we use [`${XDG_CACHE_HOME}`](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)`/hie-bios/...` (or similar depends on OS) as a build directory for Cabal.\r\n- Now Eval plugin uses the parsing mechanism of GHC and becomes more stable.\r\n- We supports a code action to disambiguate the same identifiers from multiple imports.\r\n    ![gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21860/106387152-bfd16d80-641b-11eb-9394-c553fad5794b.gif)\r\n- We supports a code action to hide shadowed identifiers from import.\r\n    ![gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26041945/107199055-e05b8200-6a30-11eb-9198-448ab8604cc0.gif)\r\n- HIE DB is now integrated. This means we now support `find-references`, `workspace-symbol`. `find-definition` is also improved in a project with multiple components.\r\n- Brittany and Stylish-haskell plugins now load language extensions from the ghc session.\r\n- Tactic plugin supports eta-reduction and Agda-like split tactic and can create a function with piecewise definitions.\r\n    ![gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/307223/107991243-0af68f00-6f8b-11eb-9ff9-3e9a7363ba5f.gif)\r\n\r\n### Pull requests merged for 1.0.0\r\n\r\n- Correctly split non-varpats in
